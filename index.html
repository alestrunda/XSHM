      exploit
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Test scenario:</strong> there is a secret page, that is cookie
      protected. So you need to use the login page to log in. The test pages
      could be located on entirely diffent server and by the using the exploit,
      the status in those test pages will tell you whether you're logged in or
      not.
      <br>
      You can use login button right through the iframe in the test pages, the refresh the page and check the status.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="test1.html">Test 1</a> (does not work in modern browsers, only
      IE)
      <br />
      <a href="test2.html">Test 2</a> (works even in modern browsers)
    </p>

    <h3>Steps of the exploit:</h3>
    <p><strong>Test 1:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>create an iframe</li>
      <li>
        set the src attribute of the iframe to the page where a user will be
        redirected to when he's not logged in
      </li>
      <li>save the current history.length</li>
      <li>
        change src attribute of the iframe to some page that is protected, hence
        user not logged in would be redirected to some login page
      </li>
      <li>
        compare the current history.length with the previous one:
        <ul>
          <li>
            if the length is different, that means the history was increased by
            one - the user is logged in and the protected page was loaded for
            him, so web browser put a new entry in the history
          </li>
          <li>
            if the length is the same, then he's not logged in, because he was
            redirected back to the login page - the iframe started at login,
            then we changed it to some other page that redirected us back to
            login. Web browser takes that like nothing happened and will not put
            a new entry in the history.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Test 2:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>create an iframe</li>
      <li>set the src attribute of the iframe to some protected page</li>
      <li>save the current history.length</li>
      <li>
        change src attribute of the iframe to the login page where the user
        would be redirected if he does not have access to the protected page
      </li>
      <li>
        compare the current history.length with the previous one:
        <ul>
          <li>
            if the length is different, that means the history was increased by
            one - the user is logged in and the protected page was loaded for
            him, so web browser put a new entry in the history when we changed
            the src to login
          </li>
          <li>
            if the length is the same, then he's not logged in, because when we
            loaded the iframe, where he was redirected to the login, then we
            changed the iframe src to the login page - web browser takes that
            like nothing happened since we're already there and will not put a
            new entry in the history
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Protection:</h3>
    <p>
      On client side use modern browser with high Content-Security-Policy. But
      that protects just for one kind of the attack, so you will need also
      protection on the server side, which is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        since the exploit uses iframe, we can use appropritate header to disable
        loading the web via iframe:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options"
              >x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors"
              >Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';</a
            >
            (not supported in legacy browsers)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        when triggering the redirect, add some randomly generated param to the
        url
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
